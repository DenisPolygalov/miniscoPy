miniscoPy
=====


A package to analyse calcium imaging data recorded with the __[Miniscope](http://miniscope.org)__. 

* miniscoPy is a Python 3 implementation of CNMF-E, an efficient algorithm to deconvolve calcium transients ([Zhou et al, 2016](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0c68/5753c9379f71b5120fe3b51589458c4de695.pdf)).
* It has been written based on the [CaImAn package](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn). The CaImAn package is a versatile tool that can do several things (two photons, one photons, online analysis, etc). Here, the main idea is to have a simple package for straightforward analysis of Miniscope data with CNMF-E.
* __What does it do?__
	* Loads Miniscope AVI files
	* Creates one HDF5 file that includes everything
	* Runs the motion correction algorithm
	* Runs CNMF-E. That's it.
* __What it does not do?__
	* Loads all the available movie format on the Planet.
	* Creates memory map.
	* Analyses two-photon imaging 
	* Other methods such as PCA/ICA, etc.

Yet, the architecture of this package is almost the same as the CaImAn package. If needed, it is thus very easy to insert CaImAn functions. Besides, the visualization tools of miniscoPy have been kept at its bare minimum purposefully.

### Overview

To take a glimpse at the package, you can look at two Jupyter notebooks :
* __[main_cnmfe_e.ipynb](main_cnmfe_e.ipynb)__ for a minimal working example with actual data.
* __[main_test_hd_generated.ipynb](main_test_hd_generated.ipynb)__ for an example with simulated data of the head-direction system (requires [BRIAN2](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [XGBoost](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html))

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This installation protocol has been tested with a freshly installed  Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. It is not guaranted for not-so-fresh-installation with python2/python3 mixing and package empilement on the edge of collapsing. If it is your case, it might be better to start a miniconda environment.

```
git clone https://github.com/peyrachelab/miniscoPy
cd miniscoPy
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

Most packages can be installed in one single command line.

```
pip3 install --user numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter pandas cython scikit-learn scikit-image sklearn h5py opencv-python tqdm future psutil
```

The most troublesome to install is __[pyav](https://mikeboers.github.io/PyAV/)__. This package allows the fast loading of the avi files generated by the miniscope recording tool. 
According to the [PyAV installation protocol](https://mikeboers.github.io/PyAV/installation.html) and for Ubuntu >= 14.04 LTS, dependencies can be installed with:
```
sudo apt-get install -y python-dev pkg-config

sudo apt-get install -y libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libavresample-dev libavfilter-dev

pip3 install av
```
If it does not work, the best strategy is to start a conda environment and do:
```
conda install av -c conda-forge
```
If you are a grumpy dude that cannot stand conda environment and has already recompiled a linux kernel, the ultimate strategy is still to compile the lib in a conda environment and then to link it by hand. 

Additional packages for running the test with generated data:
```
pip3 install --user brian2 xgboost
```

### Installing

To install miniscoPy :

```
python3 setup.py build_ext -i
python3 setup.py install --user
```


## Deployment

CNMF-E has a lot of free parameters and two recording sessions from the same animal may be best analyzed with slightly different parameters. Thus, to keep track of the parameter set for each session, miniscoPy looks for a parameter file in the recording folder in __[yaml text format](http://yaml.org/start.html)__. An example of such file can be found in _[miniscoPy/example_movies/parameters.yaml](parameters.yaml)_.

The yaml file is loaded as a dictionary at the beginning of an analysis in a Python session:
```python
import yaml
parameters = yaml.load(open('/example_movies/parameters.yaml', 'r'))
```
The [Miniscope recording software](https://github.com/daharoni/Miniscope_DAQ_Software) saves several avi files in the recording folder. Before starting the analysis pipeline, it is required to list all the avi files in a recording folder:
```python
import glob
files = glob.glob('/example_movies/*.avi')
```
Then, the first step is the motion correction algorithm :
```python
from miniscopy.base.motion_correction import *
data, video_info = normcorre(files, None, parameters['motion_correction'])
```
The second step is CNMF-E :
```python
from miniscopy import CNMFE
cnm = CNMFE(data, parameters['cnmfe'])
cnm.fit()
```
Et voila!

A minimal working example can be found in [main_cnmf_e.py](main_cnmf_e.py). Another example with generated data can be found in [main_test_hd_generated.py](main_test_hd_generated.py).
