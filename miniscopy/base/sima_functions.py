    Efficient subpixel image translation registration by cross-correlation.

    This code gives the same precision as the FFT upsampled cross-correlation
    in a fraction of the computation time and with reduced memory requirements.
    It obtains an initial estimate of the cross-correlation peak by an FFT and
    then refines the shift estimation by upsampling the DFT only in a small
    neighborhood of that estimate by means of a matrix-multiply DFT.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    src_image : ndarray
        Reference image.

    target_image : ndarray
        Image to register.  Must be same dimensionality as ``src_image``.

    upsample_factor : int, optional
        Upsampling factor. Images will be registered to within
        ``1 / upsample_factor`` of a pixel. For example
        ``upsample_factor == 20`` means the images will be registered
        within 1/20th of a pixel.  Default is 1 (no upsampling)

    space : string, one of "real" or "fourier"
        Defines how the algorithm interprets input data.  "real" means data
        will be FFT'd to compute the correlation, while "fourier" data will
        bypass FFT of input data.  Case insensitive.

    Returns:
    -------
    shifts : ndarray
        Shift vector (in pixels) required to register ``target_image`` with
        ``src_image``.  Axis ordering is consistent with numpy (e.g. Z, Y, X)

    error : float
        Translation invariant normalized RMS error between ``src_image`` and
        ``target_image``.

    phasediff : float
        Global phase difference between the two images (should be
        zero if images are non-negative).

    Raise:
    ------
     NotImplementedError("Error: register_translation only supports "
                                  "subpixel registration for 2D images")

     ValueError("Error: images must really be same size for "
                         "register_translation")

     ValueError("Error: register_translation only knows the \"real\" "
                         "and \"fourier\" values for the ``space`` argument.")

    Upsampled DFT by matrix multiplication.

    This code is intended to provide the same result as if the following
    operations were performed:
        - Embed the array "data" in an array that is ``upsample_factor`` times
          larger in each dimension.  ifftshift to bring the center of the
          image to (1,1).
        - Take the FFT of the larger array.
        - Extract an ``[upsampled_region_size]`` region of the result, starting
          with the ``[axis_offsets+1]`` element.

    It achieves this result by computing the DFT in the output array without
    the need to zeropad. Much faster and memory efficient than the zero-padded
    FFT approach if ``upsampled_region_size`` is much smaller than
    ``data.size * upsample_factor``.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    data : 2D ndarray
        The input data array (DFT of original data) to upsample.

    upsampled_region_size : integer or tuple of integers, optional
        The size of the region to be sampled.  If one integer is provided, it
        is duplicated up to the dimensionality of ``data``.

    upsample_factor : integer, optional
        The upsampling factor.  Defaults to 1.

    axis_offsets : tuple of integers, optional
        The offsets of the region to be sampled.  Defaults to None (uses
        image center)

    Returns:
    -------
    output : 2D ndarray
            The upsampled DFT of the specified region.
